# <p>Introduction</p>
Welcome to Philosopher's Cursus Project! This project is part of the curriculum within the 42 network's common core, designed to challenge students in concurrent programming and synchronization techniques. In this README, we'll guide you through understanding and tackling this project step by step.

# <p>Project Overview</p>
The Philosopher's Cursus Project is a programming assignment that draws inspiration from a classic problem in computer science known as the Dining Philosophers problem. This problem, first proposed by E. W. Dijkstra in 1965, serves as an excellent illustration of the challenges involved in concurrent programming.

In this project, you'll be tasked with creating a program that manages a group of philosophers who alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping. The goal is to ensure that each philosopher can eat without starving and that the program runs smoothly without issues such as deadlocks or data races.
